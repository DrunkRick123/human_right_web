            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We hope to do our part, no matter how small, to let people around the world understand the human rights violations experienced by the people of Xinjiang. We will contact Line’s official account and ask Line’s official staff to help promote our joint signature advocating for human rights in Xinjiang. Form, hoping to use the popular features of the Line app to achieve publicity and achieve the purpose of gathering a large number of international supporters.  This collective voice will help exert moral pressure and accountability on the Chinese Communist Party in the hope of changing the plight of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.</p>

                    <h3>The True Believer</h3>
                    <p>Chen Mingguo emphasized Xinjiang's seven-year stability, strict measures against terrorism, and de-extremification efforts. His policies focus on maintaining national unity, resisting separatism, and controlling ethnic and religious groups under the guise of "national security," drawing international criticism for suppressing freedoms and violating human rights.</p>

                    <h3>The Innovator</h3>
                    <p>Yang Fasen’s "Bay County Experience" turned citizens into propagandists for anti-extremism campaigns. His rise, backed by propaganda centers and de-extremification measures, exemplifies how grassroots officials implementing harsh Xinjiang policies quickly advance in the CCP hierarchy, reinforcing the system's oppressive governance model.</p>

                    <h3>Systematic Oppression in Xinjiang</h3>The CCP enforces systematic control through Neighbourhood Committees and Fanghuiju programs. These units monitor Uyghurs, restrict movement, and decide re-education camp detentions. Under this system, surveillance and collective punishment suppress dissent while fostering mistrust, perpetuating an endless cycle of fear and oppression.

                    <p>Date: September 21, 2024</p>
                    <p>The video explores how the Chinese Communist Party systematically controls the Uyghur population through grassroots organizations, including re-education camps, community surveillance, and infiltration of households. It also examines how fear and division are used to create internal conflicts and consolidate power.</p>
